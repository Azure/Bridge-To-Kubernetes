These are general principles that should apply to all test types (unit tests, integration, etc.).

Please add to this document whenever you think of something that should be included!

<a id="checklist">**Checklist for code changes**</a><br>
Before committing a code change, complete the applicable items:
- Run all automated tests
- Add/update tests of all types
    - Unit tests
    - Manual instructions
    - End-to-end automation (and test environment)
    - Integration tests
- If you fixed a bug, also add a test to cover the scenario to catch if your fix ever regresses
- Update the Testing section of the area's README.md
- Update this file or any other docs with helpful tips you learned
- Check performance of impacted scenarios for regressions
- If you added new functionality to Dev Spaces, update the bike sharing app and manual testing script to cover new features
- Update performance queries (and goals) to include any new perf metrics you introduce

After your code change is checked in:
- Check build results to make sure your tests are being run everywhere they should
- Check the report generated by the code coverage build to ensure code coverage numbers for your tests are being reported as expected
