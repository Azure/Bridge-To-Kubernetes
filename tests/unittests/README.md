There are a couple of ways to get code coverage numbers:
- Run locally in Visual Studio
    - Open all.sln, or the solution that contains the product code you want code coverage numbers on.
    - Choose a menu command under Tests > Analyze Code Coverage. Alternately, you can find the command in the Test Explorer tool window under the Run menu or right-click. To get total code coverage numbers for an area of product code, be sure to run all tests. 
    - View results in the Code Coverage Results tool window.
